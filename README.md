# ESP32 Oscilloscope

A FreeRTOS course project implemented on [LilyGo T-Display](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-display). 

The project will attempt to make a fully functional oscilloscope within the processing and input constraints of an ESP32 microcontroller. We will be using FreeRTOS and Robot Framework.
